menuconfig SYS_POWER_MANAGEMENT
	bool "System Power management"
	select TICKLESS_IDLE
	help
	  This option enables the board to implement extra power management
	  policies whenever the kernel becomes idle. The kernel informs the
	  power management subsystem of the number of ticks until the next kernel
	  timer is due to expire.

if SYS_POWER_MANAGEMENT
config SYS_POWER_SLEEP_STATES
	bool "Low Power states"
	depends on HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_SLEEP_1 || \
	           HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_SLEEP_2 || \
	           HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_SLEEP_3
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to interface with a power manager
	  application.  This permits the system to enter a custom CPU low power
	  state when the kernel becomes idle. The low power state could be any of
	  the CPU low power states supported by the processor.  Generally the one
	  saving most power.

config SYS_POWER_DEEP_SLEEP_STATES
	bool "Deep Sleep states"
	depends on HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP_1 || \
	           HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP_2 || \
	           HAS_SYS_POWER_STATE_DEEP_SLEEP_3
	help
	  This option enables the kernel to interface with a power manager
	  application. This permits the system to enter a Deep sleep state
	  supported by the SOC where the system clock is turned off while RAM is
	  retained. This state would be entered when the kernel becomes idle for
	  extended periods and would have a high wake latency.  Resume would be
	  from the reset vector same as cold boot. The interface allows
	  restoration of states that were saved at the time of suspend.


config SYS_PM_STATE_LOCK
	bool "Enable Power State locking capability"
	help
	  Enable Power Management system state locking capability
	  if any application wants to temporarily disable certain
	  Power States while doing any critical work or needs quick
	  response from hardware resources.

config SYS_PM_DIRECT_FORCE_MODE
	bool "Enable system power management direct force trigger mode"
	help
	  Enable system power management direct force trigger mode. In
	  this mode application thread can directly put system in sleep
	  or deep sleep mode instead of waiting for idle thread to do
	  it, so that it can reduce latency to enter low power mode.

config SYS_PM_DEBUG
	bool "Enable System Power Management debug hooks"
	help
	  Enable System Power Management debugging hooks.

config DEVICE_IDLE_PM
	bool "Enable device Idle Power Management"
	depends on DEVICE_POWER_MANAGEMENT
	select POLL
	help
	  Enable device Idle Power Management to save power.
	  With device Idle PM enabled, devices can be suspended or
	  resumed based on the device usage even while the CPU or
	  system is running.

config DEVICE_POWER_MANAGEMENT
	bool "Device power management"
	help
	  This option enables the device power management interface.  The
	  interface consists of hook functions implemented by device drivers
	  that get called by the power manager application when the system
	  is going to suspend state or resuming from suspend state. This allows
	  device drivers to do any necessary power management operations
	  like turning off device clocks and peripherals. The device drivers
	  may also save and restore states in these hook functions.
