KSCAN Interface
####################################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use the :ref:`KSCAN API <kscan_api>`.
Callbacks are registered that will write to the console indicating KSCAN events.
These events indicate key presses and releases.

Building and Running
********************

The sample can be built and executed on boards supporting a Keyboard Matrix.
Please connect a Keyboard Matrix to exercise the functionality. You need to
obtain the right keymap from the vendor because they vary across different
manufactures.

Sample output
=============

.. code-block:: console

   KSCAN test with a Keyboard matrix
   Note: You are expected to see several callbacks
   as you press and release keys!
