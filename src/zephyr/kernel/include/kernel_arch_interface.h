/**
 * Cooperatively context switch
 *
 * Architectures have considerable leeway on what the specific semantics of
 * the switch handles are, but optimal implementations should do the following
 * if possible:
 *
 * 1) Push all thread state relevant to the context switch to the current stack
 * 2) Update the switched_from parameter to contain the current stack pointer,
 *    after all context has been saved. switched_from is used as an output-
 *    only parameter and its current value is ignored (and can be NULL, see
 *    below).
 * 3) Set the stack pointer to the value provided in switch_to
 * 4) Pop off all thread state from the stack we switched to and return.
 *
 * Some arches may implement thread->switch handle as a pointer to the
 * thread itself, and save context somewhere in thread->arch. In this
 * case, on initial context switch from the dummy thread,
 * thread->switch handle for the outgoing thread is NULL. Instead of
 * dereferencing switched_from all the way to get the thread pointer,
 * subtract ___thread_t_switch_handle_OFFSET to obtain the thread
 * pointer instead.  That is, such a scheme would have behavior like
 * (in C pseudocode):
 *
 * void arch_switch(void *switch_to, void **switched_from)
 * {
 *     struct k_thread *new = switch_to;
 *     struct k_thread *old = CONTAINER_OF(switched_from, struct k_thread,
 *                                         switch_handle);
 *
 *     // save old context...
 *     *switched_from = old;
 *     // restore new context...
 * }
 *
 * Note that, regardless of the underlying handle representation, the
 * incoming switched_from pointer MUST be written through with a
 * non-NULL value after all relevant thread state has been saved.  The
 * kernel uses this as a synchronization signal to be able to wait for
 * switch completion from another CPU.
 *
 * @param switch_to Incoming thread's switch handle
 * @param switched_from Pointer to outgoing thread's switch handle storage
 *        location, which may be updated.
