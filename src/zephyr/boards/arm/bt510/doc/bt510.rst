Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ``bt510`` board configuration can be
built and flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application`
and :ref:`application_run` for more details); however, the standard
debugging targets are not currently available.

The BT510 features a TagConnect 10 way socket for connection of a
programmer/debugger, refer to `TagConnect TC2050 product page`_
for details of an appropriate TagConnect cable.

A non-standard layout is used to include access to the sensor debug UART.

+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| Pin No.   | Name       | Description          |
+===========+============+======================+
| 1         | Vcc        | Power Supply, 3.3V   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 2         | SWDIO      | SWD Data             |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 3         | RXD        | Debug UART RX Data   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 4         | SWDCLK     | SWD Clock            |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 5         | TM         | Spare GPIO           |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 6         | SWO        | SWD Output           |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 7         | N/C        | Not Connected        |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 8         | TXD        | Debug UART TX Data   |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 9         | GND        | Ground               |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+
| 10        | RESET      | Reset, Active Low    |
+-----------+------------+----------------------+

Connectivity to the programmer/debugger must be modified to match
the pinout shown above.

Laird Connectivity provide the USB-SWD programming board that supports
this connector layout, refer to the `USB SWD Programmer product page`_
.

Flashing
========

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`nordic_segger` page to install
and configure all the necessary software. Further information can be
found in :ref:`nordic_segger_flashing`. Then build and flash
applications as usual (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Here is an example for the :ref:`hello_world` application.

First, run your favorite terminal program to listen for output.

NOTE: On the BT510, the UART lines are at TTL levels and must be passed through
an appropriate line driver circuit for translation to RS232 levels. Refer to the `MAX3232 datasheet`_
for a suitable driver IC.

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D <tty_device> -b 115200

Replace :code:`<tty_device>` with the port where the bt510 can be found. For example, under Linux, :code:`/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Then build and flash the application in the usual way.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: bt510
   :goals: build flash

Note that an external debugger is required to perform application flashing.

Debugging
=========

The ``bt510`` board does not have an on-board J-Link debug IC
as some nRF5x development boards, however, instructions from the
:ref:`nordic_segger` page also apply to this board, with the additional step
of connecting an external debugger.

Testing Bluetooth on the BT510
***********************************
Many of the Bluetooth examples will work on the BT510.
Try them out:

* :ref:`ble_peripheral`
* :ref:`bluetooth-eddystone-sample`
* :ref:`bluetooth-ibeacon-sample`


Testing the LEDs and buttons on the BT510
*****************************************

There are 2 samples that allow you to test that the buttons (switches) and LEDs on
the board are working properly with Zephyr:

* :ref:`blinky-sample`
* :ref:`button-sample`

You can build and flash the examples to make sure Zephyr is running correctly on
your board. The button and LED definitions can be found in
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/bt510/bt510.dts`.
