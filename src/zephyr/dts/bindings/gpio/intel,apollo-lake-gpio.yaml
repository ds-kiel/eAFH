    Apollo Lake GPIO Map

    Map from Apollo Lake GPIO to component GPIO driver instances.

    The Apollo Lake GPIO architecture provides four controllers each of
    which has more than 32 pins.  To be supported on Zephyr these pins
    must be mapped to sub-devices that have no more than 32 pins each.
    This compatible is used to map the full controller to its
    subdevices.

    The NORTH controller supports 78 pins.
    The NORTHWEST controller supports 77 pins.
    The WEST controller supports 47 pins.
    The SOUTHWEST controller supports 43 pins.

compatible: "intel,apollo-lake-gpio"

include: [gpio-nexus.yaml, base.yaml]
