    zephyr,concat-buf-size:
        type: int
        required: false
        description:
            If concatenation buffer size is set, then multiple messages in the
            same direction will be concatenated into single transfers as long
            as there is space in buffer and no restart or stop flag is set.

            This property must be provided when interacting with devices like
            the SSD1306 display that cannot tolerate a repeated start and
            address appearing on the bus between message fragments.  For many
            devices a concatenation buffer is not necessary.
